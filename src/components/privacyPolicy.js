                  <p className="shippingPolicyText">
                    When utilizing our Platform, we systematically gather and store information provided by you on an as-needed basis. In general, you can freely navigate the Platform without disclosing your identity or personal details. However, upon sharing your personal information with us, you will no longer remain anonymous to us. We make an effort to specify which fields are mandatory and which are optional. You always have the choice to withhold information by abstaining from using specific services, products, or features on the Platform.
                    <br/>
                    We may also track your purchasing patterns, preferences, and other details you opt to provide on our Platform. This information is essential for our internal research on user demographics, interests, and behavior, enabling us to better comprehend, safeguard, and serve our users. This data is analyzed and aggregated, and it may encompass the URL from which you accessed our Platform (whether on our Platform or elsewhere), the subsequent URL you visit (whether on our Platform or elsewhere), details regarding your computer's browser, and your IP address.
                    <br/>
                    We gather personal information like email addresses, delivery addresses, names, phone numbers, credit card/debit card information, and other payment instrument details when you establish an account or carry out transactions with us. While certain sections of our Platform can be explored without registering as a member, specific activities, such as placing orders or accessing our online content and services, necessitate registration. Your contact information is used to deliver offers based on your previous orders and interests.
                    <br/>
                    If you opt to post messages in our message boards, chat rooms, or other message areas, or if you use voice commands to make purchases on the Platform, we will compile the information you provide for dispute resolution, customer support, and issue troubleshooting, as permitted by law. In the event of personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties forward correspondence regarding your activities or posts on the Platform, we may compile this information into a file specifically related to you.
                    <br/>
                    We will also collect data related to your transactions on the Platform and third-party business partner platforms. When a third-party business partner directly collects your personal information from you, their privacy policies will govern the use of your data. Truthful Treats is not accountable for the privacy practices of third-party business partners or the content of their privacy policies, and we encourage you to read their privacy policies before disclosing any information.
                    <br/>
                    Truthful Treats has collaborated with specific third-party business partners on the Platform. If you use the products or services of these Third-Party Partners, you will be directed to their websites/applications. Access to these Third-Party Partners' websites/applications is contingent on your Platform login credentials and your consent to share your data. Truthful Treats does not bear responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of Third-Party Partners' privacy policies, and we advise you to review their privacy policies before sharing any information.

                  <p className="shippingPolicyText">
                    Certain pages of the Platform utilize data collection tools like "cookies" to aid in the analysis of web page flow, gauge promotional effectiveness, and foster trust and security. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that support us in delivering our services. These cookies do not contain your personal information. Some of our features rely on the use of "cookies." Cookies also permit you to enter your password less frequently during a session and enable us to provide information tailored to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning they are automatically removed from your hard drive at the end of your session. You have the liberty to decline or delete our cookies if your browser permits, though this may limit your access to specific Platform features, potentially requiring more frequent password entry during sessions. Furthermore, you may encounter "cookies" or similar devices on select Platform pages placed by third parties. We have no control over third-party cookie usage. We place both permanent and temporary cookies on your computer's hard drive.
